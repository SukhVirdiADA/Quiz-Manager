# Quiz Manager
by Sukh Virdi
 
This application was created using the MERN technology stack to meet the project requirements assigned by BCS.

## Set Up Guide

1) Install MongoDB compass and ensure that you have it working on your local machine.
2) Either clone the repository or unzip the file I provided and navigate to the quiz-manager folder; open the folder using an IDE, cd into the `backend` of the application and install the dependencies by running `npm install`. 
3) Next, run the `npm start` command which will create the `quiz manager` database that you should see within MongoDB Compass after you press connect to see your local host connections.
4) Within my Zip File that I provided, you will find a `users.json` file that we will use by inserting the document into users collection by pressing add data, import file and selecting the json file option within MongoDB Compass.
5) Re-open your IDE and cd into the `frontend` of the application on a different terminal (server is also running), install the dependencies again by executing `npm install` and run the frontend by using the `npm start` command.
6) The table below provides the login credentials that you can use when on the login user interface (there is no existing quiz data as you have a newly created database).
